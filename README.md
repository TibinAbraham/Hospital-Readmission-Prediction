# Predicting-Hospital-Readmission-Rates

# Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify patients at risk of being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. Using the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008 dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we explore various machine learning techniques to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008 dataset. It includes over 100,000 instances of diabetic patient encounters spanning 10 years from 130 US hospitals. Key features include patient demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and readmission status.
